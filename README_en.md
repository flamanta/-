> The Seventeen Dynastic Histories are all embraced in the above.<br>
They contain examples of good and bad government,<Br>
whence may be learnt the principles of prosperity and decay.<br>
Ye who read history must study the State Annals,<br>
whereby you will understand ancient and modern events,<br>
as though having seen them with your own eyes.<br>
– **San Tzu Ching** by *Wang Yinglin, translated by Herbert Allen Giles*

As a Singaporean Chinese, I am passionate about Chinese history. My previous experiences with taking World History have led me to realise that Chinese history is not as structured, with historical events retold as tales rather than arranged in the chronological order and properly analysed. Examples include the Spring and Autumn period, which is overly focused on some states such as Zheng, Jin, Chu, Lu and Qin.

To allow myself to better understand the nearly four thousand year long history of China, I am currently editing a chronological timeline of the history of China from the Xia dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. *Right now, I do not know how to arrange the Sixteen Kingdoms, Northern and Southern Dynasties period and the period when Song, Liao, Jin and Western Xia coexisted. Guess I will when I go along.*
